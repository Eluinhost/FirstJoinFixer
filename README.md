FirstJoinFixer
==============

Normally when a player joins the game for the first time they will always spawn within a random distance of the spawn
point (and often on the roof). With MultiWorld dying will always place you at the spawn point. This is a _very_ simple
plugin that forces a first join account to be at the world spawn exactly instead of randomly (allowing roofed spawns)
